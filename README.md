## Description
Our project "Hand controlled tilting maze" is a fun, interactive game that requires concentration, fine motor skills, quick reflexes and good coordination. It carries the old and boring maze into the 21st century by allowing the player to control the platform with the ball from a distance by movement of his hand. The aim is to guide the marble through the maze and reach the final destination. This, of course, will only be possible with the help of our special controller, which in turn detects which side it is tilted on and moves the maze accordingly.
  
Our project addresses people's need for an entertaining way to improve their reflections and concentration. This type of games improves coordination between hands and eyes.
